## 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- Input validation using `try`/`except`
- Custom functions like `getFloatInput()`
- Data formatting with `f-strings` and `NUMBER_FORMAT = ",.2f"`
- Reading from and writing to files
- Looping (`for`, `while`) and logic control
- Dictionaries for mapping and decoding
- Working with lists: `append`, `sort`, `sum`, `min`, `max`
- Finding medians manually
- Multi-function program structure with `main()`
- Separation of logic and output (clean structure!)
- Using constants like `WIN`, `DRAW`, `LOSS`

## 🐇 Special Fun Stuff
- Added an Easter egg line: "George is the winner!"
- Bonus mode for Joe (TA)
- Created a structured Advent of Code project
- Named the assistant George (after the Looney Tunes joke)
- Debated over `tuple` vs `toople`

---

## 📁 File/Project Structure Notes
- Used virtual environments (`env`, `env2`) per project
- Real Estate Analyzer & Banking Project used clean function blocks
- Advent of Code structured with utils folder & `load_input()`

---

## 🔁 Tips to Resume
- Re-upload your saved code files if needed
- If continuing Advent of Code, make sure the input files are in place
- Ask George to help you pick the next AoC challenge or review dictionary mini-challenges
